## **Base Infomation**

Yiyuan Wang, male, associate professor, PhD supervisor, received my PhD degree in engineering from School of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University in 2017. I'm mainly engaged in the research of artificial intelligence, algorithm design and its application, optimization solution, etc. I was awarded the Jilin Young Talent Support Program in 2020. I have published more than 30 papers, 12 of which are in CCF A category.

Optimization problems are everywhere in the real world, and we welcome undergraduate and graduate students who are interested in studying how to solve discrete/continuous optimization problems intelligently under massive data to join our team!
